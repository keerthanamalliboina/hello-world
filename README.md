Fundamental goal of this project is to get any sort of permission online by simply sending a
message to the concerned authority like leader or manager. Generally getting a permission
follows the hierarchy of leader and manager in corporate companies. So, when an employee
wants to get approval to his leave, he sends a request message to the leader. Leader approves
if he finds it sensible and sends for the approval of Manager. He does the same. If he affirms
leave, a letter will be generated with a unique id where employee can use it for other purposes.
